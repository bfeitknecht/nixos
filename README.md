# Configuration

- `stow` relative local configs to `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
    - As much as possible not through Home Manager
    - Link as part of derivation, fail if local state incorrect
- Set `XDG_*`

## Darwin

- TouchID for `sudo`

## Linux

- Configure Wayland and everything (another can of worms)
